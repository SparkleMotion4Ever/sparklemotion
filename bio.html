            <h2>Childhood, Adolescence, and Early Adulthood</h2>
            <p>I grew up on the Great Plains and migrated to California during my teenage years. My upbringing was challenging, shaped by difficult family dynamics that eventually led me to leave home at the age of 16. Throughout my twenties, I faced significant mental health struggles while exploring various forms of creative expression. Some of my work, including the playful use of ðŸ’©, became misunderstood and impacted my reputation. Looking back, I recognize that many of my actions were influenced by unresolved personal challenges, which Iâ€™ve since worked to address. Over time, Iâ€™ve focused on personal growth and resilience, and today, Iâ€™m committed to building a healthier, more stable future, using my past experiences to guide me forward.</p>

            <h2>The Sober Slump</h2>
            <p>I struggled with a meth addiction for about seven years in my twenties, and sobriety, instead of being the fresh start I had hoped for, felt more like a slump. The meetings didnâ€™t resonate with me, and I found it hard to connect with the people, who left little impression. During my early recovery, I opened up to a sponsor about some of my past work, including the fake ðŸ’© art I had created while using methâ€”something that, in hindsight, seemed more like a psychotic reaction to the drugs than anything else. What I thought was a confidential conversation soon became public, damaging my reputation within the community. This deepened my disconnect from the 12-step program, where I struggled with the idea that everything wrong in life could be attributed to personal defects that needed to be "fixed" through the steps. Iâ€™ve always believed addiction is a physical response to a substance, not a spiritual issue. The program doesnâ€™t address the real nature of addiction and instead conditions people to believe things about themselves that simply arenâ€™t true.
