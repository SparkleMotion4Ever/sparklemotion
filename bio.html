            <h2>Childhood and Adolescence</h2>
            <p>On the surface, my early years might have seemed idyllic, but behind closed doors, they were marked by abuse at the hands of my father and other men. This continued until I was 16 and could finally leave home. These experiences shaped my understanding of resilience and survival in ways I didnâ€™t fully grasp at the time. While those years were far from what they appeared to be, they became a crucial part of my journey toward healing and self-discovery. Though painful, these formative years taught me how to persevere through the most challenging circumstances.</p>

            <h2>Early Adulthood</h2>
            <p>As I entered adulthood, I struggled with the long-term effects of the trauma I had endured. Mental health challenges such as bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other complex conditions were ever-present. During this time, I also engaged in risky behaviors and developed unhealthy coping mechanisms, including the use of illegal drugs. As the drugs interacted with my various disorders, I experienced multiple instances of dissociation, and ðŸ’© happened. It was a period marked by confusion and instability, but it ultimately played a significant role in helping me confront and understand my mental health and begin the path toward healing.</p>
