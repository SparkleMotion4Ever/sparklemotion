            <h2>Childhood, Adolescence, and Early Adulthood</h2>
            <p>I faced significant challenges growing up, and by the time I was 16, I left home to escape those circumstances. Throughout my twenties, I struggled with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder, enduring numerous hospitalizations as I tried to manage my mental health alone. During this time, my use of meth fueled risky behaviors and artistic expressions, some of which played on taboo subjects like ðŸ’©. While these works were meant as provocative art, they were also tied to deeper, more complex aspects of my identity and struggles. It wasnâ€™t until I broke free from meth that I was able to leave this chapter behind and begin focusing on a healthier, more stable future.</p>

            <h2>The Sober Slump</h2>
            <p>Sobriety was a difficult period for me, one that felt more like a slump than the fresh start I had hoped for. I didnâ€™t connect with the meetings or the people, often feeling like an outsider in a space that was meant to provide support. My view of the 12-step program only deepened that disconnect. I donâ€™t believe that attributing everything wrong in your life to your own character defects, and praying it away through the steps, is helpful for someone battling addiction. Addiction is a physiological reactionâ€”your bodyâ€™s response to a chemicalâ€”not a spiritual malady, as they claim. This approach felt dismissive of the real, physical nature of addiction, which is why the program didnâ€™t resonate with me.</p><p>

            <p>Unfortunately, my reputation for ðŸ’© stemmed from this very community. Early in my recovery, I confided in my sponsor about why I had initially quit using meth, sharing deeply personal details. Rather than respecting my trust, he spread this information throughout the community, and the rumors stuck. What was supposed to be a journey of healing instead became a time marked by both recovery and a growing sense of isolation, as my past was shared without my consent, and my reputation suffered as a result.</p>
