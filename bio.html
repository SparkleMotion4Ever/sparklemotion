            <h2>Childhood, Adolescence, and Early Adulthood</h2>
            <p>I faced significant challenges growing up, and by the time I was 16, I left home to escape those circumstances. Throughout my twenties, I struggled with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar disorder, enduring numerous hospitalizations as I tried to manage my mental health alone. During this time, my use of meth fueled risky behaviors and artistic expressions, some of which played on taboo subjects like ðŸ’©. While these works were meant as provocative art, they were also tied to deeper, more complex aspects of my identity and struggles. It wasnâ€™t until I broke free from meth that I was able to leave this chapter behind and begin focusing on a healthier, more stable future.</p>
