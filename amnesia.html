            <h2>Amnesia and the üåà CCSF X-ray Department</h2>
            <p>
                With my memories of people, places, and things related to my hometown washed away. I took an interest in school and began the long journey of attending City College of San Francisco (CCSF) for an x-ray license. After years of hard work, I was finally admitted to the program and excelled in my studies. However, the discrimination and mistreatment I experienced from the faculty was egregious enough to warrant an ethics investigation‚Äîor even a lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
    Before my internship, I learned from classmates that my clinical coordinator had been gossiping about my grades and other personal details. I reported this to the program director, who promised to look into it, but I never heard back. Soon after, while externing at the Mission-Bernal campus, an instructor asked me point-blank if I ‚Äúplayed in üí©.‚Äù This line of questioning, combined with my amnesia related to past traumatic events, left me deeply unsettled.  These rumors were also spread to my classmates and employees of UCSF.
            </p>
            <P>The situation escalated when I was called into the program director‚Äôs office and interrogated for 30 minutes. The questioning was irrelevant and humiliating, especially given my trauma. The fact that LGBT faculty members were involved made it an even deeper blow, considering the abuse I experienced growing up in an LGBT household. This discrimination left me with severe PTSD, which caused me to underperform as an intern and ultimately withdraw from the program.</P>
            <p>When I raised my concerns to the chancellor, my complaint was dismissed, and I was even advised that I could sue. At the time, the personal nature of the harassment and discrimination was too distressing for me to pursue legal action, so I chose to walk away and enroll in another school to complete my x-ray license. Looking back, I now realize I had every right to pursue legal action for the blatant violations of privacy, professional conduct, and the discriminatory treatment I endured at CCSF.</p>
