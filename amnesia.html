            <h2>Amnesia and the ðŸŒˆ CCSF X-ray Department</h2>
            <p>
                With my memories of people, places, and events related to my hometown already fading due to long-term amnesia, I turned my focus to education and embarked on the journey of attending City College of San Francisco (CCSF) to earn an x-ray license. Even though I had been suffering from memory loss for years, I pushed through the challenges and was eventually admitted to the program, where I excelled academically. However, the discrimination and mistreatment I faced from the faculty were severe enough to warrant an ethics investigationâ€”or even legal action.
</p>
<p>
    Before my internship began, I was informed by classmates that my clinical coordinator had been gossiping about my grades and personal matters. When I reported this to the program director, I was assured it would be looked into, but nothing ever came of it. Soon after, while externing at the Mission-Bernal campus, an instructor asked me directly if I "played in ðŸ’©," an insensitive remark considering my past trauma and the memory issues I was dealing with. This inappropriate line of questioning was not only humiliating but exacerbated by rumors spreading among my classmates and even reaching employees at UCSF.
            </p>
            <P>The situation spiraled when I was called into the program directorâ€™s office for a 30-minute interrogation. The questioning was irrelevant, deeply personal, and humiliatingâ€”especially in light of the amnesia I was already struggling with from past trauma. The involvement of LGBT faculty members made the situation even more painful, considering the abuse I had endured growing up in an LGBT household. The result of this mistreatment was severe PTSD, which affected my performance as an intern and eventually led me to withdraw from the program.</P>
            <p>This period of amnesia had begun years before I attended CCSF and persisted throughout my time there. During those years, my reputation within the community was severely damaged by gossip and rumors that I was unable to address due to my memory loss. The rumors that had started well before my enrollment only worsened, and I found myself ostracized and humiliated, both within the community and at the school.</p>
            <p>When I eventually raised my concerns to the chancellor, my complaint was dismissed, and I was advised to consider legal action. At the time, the deeply personal nature of the harassment and discrimination made pursuing legal action feel impossible. So, I chose to leave the situation behind, completing my x-ray license at another institution. Looking back, I realize that I had every right to hold the parties accountable for the violations of my privacy, professional ethics, and the discriminatory treatment I endured at CCSF.</p>
