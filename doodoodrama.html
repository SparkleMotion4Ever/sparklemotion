            <h2>Post ðŸ’© Drama and Attempted Murder</h2>
<p>
    By the mid-2010s, my time in the 12-step community was wearing thin. Despite my efforts to move forward, I had been dodging persistent rumors about my past for over a decade. The topic of ðŸ’©, which stemmed from episodes over 10 years prior, was coming up almost weekly, if not daily, within the community. At one point, a drag queen expressed interest, and I made the mistake of showing her an old chatroom I hadnâ€™t logged into in years. She was shocked, and though I immediately apologized and even volunteered at a nonprofit of her choice to make amends, the situation quickly escalated.</p>
    <p>Word quickly spread through the community, eventually reaching a bartender and a fashion designer I had interacted with in those same chatrooms. The bartender, who had grown resentful, orchestrated a setup with the fashion designer to have me roofied while I was DJing at a local bathhouse. The goal was to get me disoriented and force a confession, punishing me for mentioning the chatrooms where they had all been involved in far worse things than what I had revealed. In my vulnerable state, I ended up confessing to a drag queen, and the details were shared publicly almost immediately. The fallout was swift, leading to widespread mockery and humiliation, and leaving me with lasting memory issues and trauma that still affect me today.
</p>

<p>
    Although I had been advised to stay away from the bar where the bartender worked, my memory issues caused me to return. During one visit, the bartender casually brought up concerns about a ðŸ§’ being abused in the community, which led me to uncover even more disturbing situations involving others. When I mentioned the possibility of going to the authorities, things quickly escalated. I was publicly humiliated yet again, dragged in front of a crowd that included those involved in the abuses, and jeered at until I eventually fainted. The incident worsened my memory issues and left me even more disoriented.
 </p>
 <p>
    Later, I was invited back to the bar under the pretense of a DJ gig, but what awaited me was an attempted murder. I was physically restrained by several people, injected with a needle, and then dumped outside. The aftermath was devastatingâ€”near-total kidney failure and a host of other significant memory issues that persisted for years. The emotional and physical scars from that night run deep. In hindsight, I realize I could have pursued legal action to hold those responsible accountable, but at the time, the weight of the ongoing trauma left me too overwhelmed to take those steps. If you have any information regarding these crimes, please contact the FBI.
