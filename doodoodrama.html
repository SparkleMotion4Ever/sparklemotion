            <h2>Post ðŸ’© Drama and Attempted Murder</h2>
<p>
    By the mid-2010s, my time in the 12-step community was wearing thin. Despite my efforts to move forward, I had been dodging persistent rumors about my past for over a decade. The topic of ðŸ’©, which stemmed from episodes over 10 years prior, was coming up almost weekly, if not daily, within the community. At one point, a drag queen expressed interest, and I made the mistake of showing her an old chatroom I hadnâ€™t logged into in years. She was shocked, and though I immediately apologized and even volunteered at a nonprofit of her choice to make amends, the situation quickly escalated.</p>
    <p>Word quickly spread through the community, including to a bartender and a fashion designer I had previously interacted with in those chatrooms. While DJing at a local bathhouse, I was roofied, leaving me disoriented, during which time I was coerced into confessing about my past yet again. This information was immediately shared publicly, leading to widespread mockery and humiliation, resulting in lasting memory issues and trauma.
</p>

<p>
    Although I had been advised to avoid the bar where the bartender worked, my memory issues led me to return. During one visit, the bartender mentioned concerns about a ðŸ§’ being abused in the community, which led me to uncover similar situations involving others. When I mentioned going to the authorities, I faced public humiliation once again, being dragged in front of a crowd of others engaged in the abuses and jeered at until I fainted. This further exacerbated my memory problems and left me disoriented.
 </p>
 <p>
    Later, I was invited back to the bar for a DJ gig, but instead, I was physically restrained and injected with a needle, my body being dumped outside. This resulted in significant health issues, including near-total kidney failure. These events left me with deep emotional and physical scars that still affect me to this day. In hindsight, I realize I could have pursued legal action to address the mistreatment and ensure accountability, but I was too overwhelmed by the ongoing trauma at the time to take those steps.
