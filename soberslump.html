            <h2>Childhood, Adolescence, and Early Adulthood</h2>
<p>After I stopped using party drugs, I joined the 12-step community, but looking back, it wasn’t the fresh start I had hoped for. The idea that addiction was some universal condition just didn’t resonate with me. While addiction might be a disease for a few, I couldn’t shake the feeling that many people in those meetings didn’t need to be there. Most can handle their lives without that level of intervention, but they seem trapped in the cycle. For me, it was a place where my past followed me—my sponsor shared details about my life that should’ve stayed private, and that gossip stuck to me for years. I felt like a hostage to the program, afraid to leave because they knew too much. Though I found parts of it helpful, I never fully connected with the community or the approach, and eventually, I realized it wasn’t for me.
