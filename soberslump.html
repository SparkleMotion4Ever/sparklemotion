            <h2>The Sober Slump</h2>
<p>After I stopped using party drugs, I joined the 12-step community, but looking back, it wasn’t the fresh start I had hoped for. The idea that addiction was some universal condition just didn’t resonate with me. While addiction might be a disease for a few, I couldn’t shake the feeling that many people in those meetings didn’t need to be there. Most can handle their lives without that level of intervention, but they seem trapped in the cycle. For me, it was a place where my past followed me—my sponsor shared details about my life that should’ve stayed private, and that gossip stuck to me for years. I felt like a hostage to the program, afraid to leave because they knew too much. Though I found parts of it helpful, I never fully connected with the community or the approach, and eventually, I realized it wasn’t for me.
</p><p>
    Now, I rarely drink more than one 🍺 after work—if at all—and I’ve found that Happy Hour on weekends is a much better life than strict sobriety ever was. I’ll take an edible after work or when I go out, and that’s pretty low-key too. No meth or slipping back into old habits, just a balanced approach that lets me enjoy life on my own terms.
