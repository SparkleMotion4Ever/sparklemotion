            <h2>Current Mood</h2>
<p>Looking ahead, I’ve got some exciting plans in the works, including a secret app that’s been brewing in my mind for a while. I’d love to return to DJing, bringing a fresh spin to the scene—maybe even finding a playful way to weave in the doo doo rumors that have followed me for years. After all, why not take something that’s haunted me and turn it into a unique part of my creative expression? I'm all about owning my story and making it work for me. The future looks fun, and I’m ready for whatever comes next.</p></div></section></body></html>
