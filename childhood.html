            <h2>Childhood, Adolescence, and Early Adulthood</h2>
<p>I grew up on the Great Plains and moved to California as an adolescent. My upbringing was challenging, shaped by difficult and perverse family dynamics. As a teen, I faced disturbing experiences, including an incident where someone I trusted threatened me in a terrifying way, which ultimately led to his imprisonment. At 16, I left home to escape those circumstances. Throughout my twenties, I struggled with mental health issues and found myself involved in some unusual situations during a time when I was also experimenting with party drugs. One phase, in particular, left a lasting impression, symbolized by ðŸ’© that became a misunderstood part of my past. Thankfully, I eventually stopped using party drugs and moved on from that period, though the reputation has lingeredâ€”and, admittedly, Iâ€™ve played into it at times.</p>
