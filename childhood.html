            <p>I grew up on the Great Plains and moved to California as an adolescent. My upbringing was challenging, shaped by difficult and perverse family dynamics. As a teen, I faced disturbing experiences, including an incident where someone I trusted threatened me in a terrifying way, which ultimately led to his imprisonment. At 16, I left home to escape those circumstances. Throughout my twenties, I struggled with mental health issues and found myself involved in some unusual situations during a time when I was also experimenting with party drugs. One phase, in particular, left a lasting impression, symbolized by ðŸ’© that became a misunderstood part of my past. Thankfully, I eventually stopped using party drugs and moved on from that period, though the reputation has lingeredâ€”and, admittedly, Iâ€™ve played into it at times.</p>

            <h2>The Sober Slump</h2>
            <p>I struggled with a meth addiction for about seven years in my twenties, and sobriety, instead of being the fresh start I had hoped for, felt more like a slump. The meetings didnâ€™t resonate with me, and I found it hard to connect with the people, who left little impression. During my early recovery, I opened up to a sponsor about some of my past work, including the fake ðŸ’© art I had created while using methâ€”something that, in hindsight, seemed more like a psychotic reaction to the drugs than anything else. What I thought was a confidential conversation soon became public, damaging my reputation within the community. This deepened my disconnect from the 12-step program, where I struggled with the idea that everything wrong in life could be attributed to personal defects that needed to be "fixed" through the steps. Iâ€™ve always believed addiction is a physical response to a substance, not a spiritual issue. The program doesnâ€™t address the real nature of addiction and instead conditions people to believe things about themselves that simply arenâ€™t true.
